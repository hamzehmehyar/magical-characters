# magical-characters

this website project is representing the characters of Harry Poter with a filter that shows every character house, representing these characters into beautifull cards. 


 - Questions anwering

    1 - Actually my questions from what I've learnt and what I searched about, that are we going to use DOM manipulation everytime we want to code, but I think that frameworks came to solve this problem and avoid writing repititve things, so frameworks came to speed the proccess

    2 - and this assignment took me 2 days to finish, 1 day for writing the JavaScript file to fetch the data and to be able to combine it with the filtering function, and half a day for styling.

    - Here's the link after the deployment:

        note: if something got stuck when openinig the website or the cards didn't appear use the filter dropdown menu again
